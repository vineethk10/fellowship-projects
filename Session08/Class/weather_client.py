weather_client.py — WeatherClient class
Session 08: APIs, HTTP Requests + Environment Variables

What this file is:
  A module that contains ONE class: WeatherClient.
  This is the S7 pattern: one module, one responsibility.
  The class itself is the S5 pattern: class, __init__, instance methods.

Why a class (not functions)?
  Because in production, API clients are always classes.
  The class holds shared configuration (__init__: base URLs, timeout).
  The methods do the individual jobs: geocode, fetch weather.
  main.py creates one instance and calls its methods — separation of concerns.
