result_saver.py — ResultSaver class
Session 08: APIs, HTTP Requests + Environment Variables

What this file is:
  A module with ONE class: ResultSaver.
  It handles saving API results to a JSON file.

S6 connection (File Handling + Data Formats):
  You already know how to read and write JSON files.
  Today we wrap that knowledge in a class so it is reusable across sessions.

S5 connection (OOP):
  __init__ takes the filepath once — every method can then use self.filepath.
  We don't pass the filepath to every method call. We set it once, use it everywhere.

class ResultSaver:
    """
    Saves weather API results to a JSON file.

    Each call to save() APPENDS a new record — it never overwrites existing data.
    This is the correct pattern: preserve history, don't destroy it.
    """

    def __init__(self, filepath):
        """
        Store the output filepath.
        Every method that reads or writes uses self.filepath — set it once here.

        Append one weather result to the JSON file.

        Steps (same S6 pattern you already know):
          1. Build a dict for this result.
          2. Read the existing file (if it exists) to get previous records.
          3. Append the new record to the list.
          4. Write the updated list back to the file.
